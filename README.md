<br>
A good developer should always aim to benefit people, build something maintainable and easy to understand. 
The most important set of skills in this field are:
<br>

- ### **Good time management:**

  Improving your speed in reaching solutions, avoid wasting your time on rewriting code when it's not necessary or getting stuck in a learning loop should be the 3 main priorities that each good developer possesses.

- ### **Being effecient:**

  Managing your priorities & reducing complexity are the main set of tools you need to  be effecient in writing your code.

- ### **Work smartly:**

  Automation is your best friend in this area, using available libraries instead of rewriting something from scratch or sticking to *"Quality over quantity"* will surely make you the smartest developer in the room.


- ### **Last but not least:**

  Keep learning and know when to stop and take a break, you need the rest in order to make your problem solving skills as sharp as they can be.
